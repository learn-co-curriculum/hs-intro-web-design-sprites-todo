# Sprites Practice

Sprites are typically used in nav bars, for displaying the different pages a user is visiting. We've got a nav bar sprite, stored as `nav-bar-sprite.gif`.

Your job is to set up the nav bar so that it looks like this:

And then  set up the hover actions so that when a user hovers their cursor over each nav item, it looks like this:

Take a look at `pages/index.html` in the text editor. You can see we've set up the nav links for you.  You'll be coding your solution in `css/style.css`. You'll notice we've set up some basic CSS for you. We've set  `display: inline-block` as well as the background image.

## Get Started

**Step 1:** First, you need to set up the normal nav bar. Each link for each nav item should just display the appropriate item. In order for the hover to work, each link needs to be a separate piece of the sprite.

**Step 2:** Once you have the navigation bar set up, you need to set up the hover. When a user hovers over the nav item, we should see the dark navy color.

**BONUS:** See if you can get the orange color to show up when the link is "active", which is the state when the link is being clicked.
